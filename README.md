# Infrastructure Documentation Repository

This repository contains documentation for a typical enterprise infrastructure setup, serving as a reference architecture for multi-tier environments. The documentation is sanitized for public sharing and contains no business-critical information.

## üìã Repository Contents

### üìÅ [infrastructure/](./infrastructure/)
- **[Networks.md](./infrastructure/Networks.md)** - Network segmentation documentation
- **[Servers.md](./infrastructure/Servers.md)** - Server inventory and roles
- **[Services.md](./infrastructure/Services.md)** - Service catalog and dependencies

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Overview

This documentation represents a typical enterprise infrastructure with the following characteristics:

### Server Inventory
- **Total Servers**: 16
- **Operating Systems**: 
  - Windows Server (12 servers)
  - Linux (4 servers)
- **Environments**: Production, Staging, Development

### Network Architecture
The infrastructure follows a segmented network approach with:

- **Production Networks** - Hosting business-critical applications and databases
- **Staging Networks** - Pre-production testing and validation environment
- **Development Networks** - Supporting development and testing activities
- **Special Networks** - Voice communications and storage systems
- **DevOps Networks** - Automation and deployment infrastructure

### Service Categories

#### Core Business Services
- Stock Management System
- Point of Sale (POS) System
- Document Management
- Business Intelligence & Reporting

#### Infrastructure Services
- Active Directory Domain Services
- DNS & DHCP Services
- Web Services (IIS)
- Database Services (SQL Server)

#### Communication Services
- VoIP Telephony
- Internal Communication Systems

#### Automation Services
- Scheduled Job Processing
- Batch Data Processing
